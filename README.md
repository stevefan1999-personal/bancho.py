bancho.py is an in-progress osu! server implementation for developers of all levels
of experience interested in hosting their own osu private server instance(s).

the project is developed primarily by the [Akatsuki](https://akatsuki.pw/) team,
and our aim is to create the most easily maintainable, reliable, and feature-rich
osu! server implementation available.

# Prerequisites
knowledge of linux, python, and databases will certainly help, but are by no
means required.

(lots of people have installed this server with no prior programming experience!)

if you get stuck at any point in the process - we have a public discord above :)

this guide will be targetted towards ubuntu - other distros may have slightly
different setup processes.

# Requirements
bancho.py is a ~15,000 line codebase built on the shoulder of giants.

we aim to minimize our dependencies, but still rely on ones such as
- python (programming language)
- mysql (relational database)
- redis (in memory database)
- nginx (http(s) reverse proxy)
- geoip2 (an nginx module)
- certbot (ssl certificate tool)
- build-essential (build tools for c/c++)

as well as some others.

# Docker installation
for ease of use, we recommend you to use this method.

all the dependencies are all retrieved by and contained within docker containers. all you need to install on your system is docker and docker-compose, and ensure that your user is a member of the docker group. if your package manager doesn't do that for you, you may need to log out and back in.
## installing bancho.py's requirements
```sh
# install docker and docker-compose
sudo apt install -y docker \
                    docker-compose
```
## download the osu! server codebase onto your machine
```sh
# clone bancho.py's repository
git clone https://github.com/osuAkatsuki/bancho.py

# enter bancho.py's new directory
cd bancho.py
```
## configuring bancho.py
all configuration for the osu! server (bancho.py) itself can be done from the
`.env` file. we provide an example `.env.example` file which you can use as a base.
```sh
# create a configuration file from the sample provided
cp docker.env.example .env

# you'll want to configure *at least* the three marked (XXX) variables,
# as well as set the OSU_API_KEY if you need any info from osu!'s v1 api
# (e.g. beatmaps).

# open the configuration file for editing
nano .env
```
## configuring a reverse proxy (we'll use nginx)
```sh
# copy the example nginx configuration file
cp ext/docker-nginx.conf.example ext/nginx.conf

# now, you can edit the config file.
# the spots you'll need to change are marked.
nano ext/nginx.conf
```

## congratulations! you just set up an osu! private server

if everything went well, you should be able to start your server up:

```sh
# start all containers in detached mode (running in the background)
docker-compose up -d
# done!
```

additionally, these commands could help you in case you need to know the status of the containers
```sh
# list containers
docker container ls

# fetch logs of a container
# replace <container_name> with the name of the container
# examples:
# - docker container logs banchopy-bancho-1
# - docker container logs banchopy-mysql-1
docker container logs <container_name>
```
for more information, see the [docker-cli documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).

# Manual installation
## installing bancho.py's requirements
```sh
# python3.9 is often not available natively,
# but we can rely on deadsnakes to provide it.
# https://github.com/deadsnakes/python3.9
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes

# install required programs for running bancho.py
sudo apt install -y python3.9-dev python3.9-distutils \
                    build-essential \
                    mysql-server redis-server \
                    nginx certbot

# optionally, install the nginx geoip2 module if you would like to use it in bancho.py
cd tools && ./enable_geoip_module.sh && cd ..

# install python's package manager, pip
# it's used to install python-specific dependencies
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python3.9 get-pip.py && rm get-pip.py

# make sure pip and setuptools are up to date
python3.9 -m pip install -U pip setuptools pipenv

# install bancho.py's python-specific dependencies
# (if you plan to work as a dev, you can use `make install-dev`)
make install
```

## creating a database for bancho.py
you will need to create a database for bancho.py to store persistent data.

the server uses this database to store metadata & logs, such as user accounts
and stats, beatmaps and beatmapsets, chat channels, tourney mappools and more.

```sh
# start your database server
sudo service mysql start

# login to mysql's shell with root - the default admin account

# note that this shell can be rather dangerous - it allows users
# to perform arbitrary sql commands to interact with the database.

# it's also very useful, powerful, and quick when used correctly.
sudo mysql
```

from this mysql shell, we'll want to create a database, create a user account,
and give the user full permissions to the database.

then, later on, we'll configure bancho.py to use this database as well.
```sql
# you'll need to change:
# - YOUR_DB_NAME
# - YOUR_DB_USER
# - YOUR_DB_PASSWORD

# create a database for bancho.py to use
CREATE DATABASE YOUR_DB_NAME;

# create a user to use the bancho.py database
CREATE USER 'YOUR_DB_USER'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_DB_PASSWORD';

# grant the user full access to all tables in the bancho.py database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON YOUR_DB_NAME.* TO 'YOUR_DB_USER'@'localhost';

# make sure privilege changes are applied immediately.
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

# exit the mysql shell, back to bash
quit
```

## setting up the database's structure for bancho.py
we've now created an empty database - databases are full of 2-dimensional
tables of data.

bancho.py has many tables it uses to organize information, for example, there
are tables like `users` and `scores` for storing their respective information.

the columns (vertical) represent the types of data stored for a `user` or `score`.
for example, the number of 300s in a score, or the privileges of a user.

the rows (horizontal) represent the individual items or events in a table.
for example, an individual score in the scores table.

this base state of the database is stored in `migrations/base.sql`; it's a bunch of
sql commands that can be run in sequence to create the base state we want.
```sh
# you'll need to change:
# - YOUR_DB_NAME
# - YOUR_DB_USER

# import bancho.py's mysql structure to our new db
# this runs the contents of the file as sql commands.
mysql -u YOUR_DB_USER -p YOUR_DB_NAME < migrations/base.sql

```
## configuring a reverse proxy (we'll use nginx)
bancho.py relies on a reverse proxy for tls (https) support, and for ease-of-use
in terms of configuration. nginx is an open-source and efficient web server we'll
be using for this guide, but feel free to check out others, like caddy and h2o.

```sh
# copy the example nginx config to /etc/nginx/sites-available,
# and make a symbolic link to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
sudo cp ext/manual-nginx.conf.example /etc/nginx/sites-available/bancho.conf
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bancho.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bancho.conf

# now, you can edit the config file.
# the spots you'll need to change are marked.
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/bancho.conf

# reload config from disk
sudo nginx -s reload
```

## configuring bancho.py
all configuration for the osu! server (bancho.py) itself can be done from the
`.env` file. we provide an example `.env.example` file which you can use as a base.
```sh
# create a configuration file from the sample provided
cp manual.env.example .env

# you'll want to configure *at least* all the database related fields (DB_*),
# as well as set the OSU_API_KEY if you need any info from osu!'s v1 api
# (e.g. beatmaps).

# open the configuration file for editing
nano .env
```

## congratulations! you just set up an osu! private server

if everything went well, you should be able to start your server up:

```sh
# start the server
make run
```

and you should see something along the lines of:

# enabling https traffic
## using cloudflare full (strict)
first of all you need a cloudflare account, to create one go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up, enter your email and password and click on `create account`

![Step 1](.github/images/ssl_cf_1.png)

now you have to enter your domain. this has to be your actual domain (e.g. `banchopy.com` or `banchopy.net`) and mustn't include any domain-specific hostnames (e.g. `www.banchopy.com` or similar)

![Step 2](.github/images/ssl_cf_2.png)

then you have to choose your plan, for us it should be enough with the `Free plan`, you can also upgrade later if you need it

![Step 3](.github/images/ssl_cf_3.png)

now you'll have to copy the nameservers required by Cloudflare to your domain registrar. once you've done this, click on `check nameservers`

![Step 4](.github/images/ssl_cf_4.png)

once you have finished the above you'll have to add some dns records (A records) so that the necessary domains are being pointed to the ip where bancho.py is running.

you can generate the records to import in cloudflare using the script inside the `tools` folder

```sh
cd tools && ./generate_cf_dns_records.sh && cd..
```

and on the cloudflare dashboard click Import and Export

![Step 5](.github/images/ssl_cf_5.png)

If you use free freenom domains like `.ml`, `.ga`, `.ml`, `.cf`, you probably can't import the dns, this is because they are restricted in the Cloudflare API due to significant abuses, in that case you'll have to add the following dns records manually

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
        <ul>
            <li>a.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>api.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>assets.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>c1.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>c2.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>c3.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>c4.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>c5.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>c6.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>ce.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>cho.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>c.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>i.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>map.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>osu.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>s.yourdomain.com</li>
            <li>web.yourdomain.com</li>
        </ul>
        <th>
            <img src=".github/images/ssl_cf_6.png" alt="Step 6">
        </th>
    </tr>
</table>

then go to SSL/TLS > overwiew and activate Full (strict)

![Step 7](.github/images/ssl_cf_7.png)

now you'll need to create certificates generated by cloudflare, SSL>TLS > Origin Server and click on `create certificate`

![Step 8](.github/images/ssl_cf_8.png)

![Step 9](.github/images/ssl_cf_9.png)

after creating it you'll have to save the content of the origin certificate and the private key in different files in your client

![Step 10](.github/images/ssl_cf_10.png)

```sh
nano example.com.pem
# paste the content of the origin certificate

nano example.com.key
# paste the content of the private key
```

## using an own ssl certificate

```sh
# you'll need to change:
# - YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS
# - YOUR_DOMAIN

# generate an ssl certificate for your domain
sudo certbot certonly \
    --manual \
    --preferred-challenges=dns \
    --email YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS \
    --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
    --agree-tos \
    -d *.YOUR_DOMAIN
```

## enabling cloudflare geolocation data
You have to go to the cloudflare dashboard and go to Rules > Transform rules, after that click on managed transforms and activate `add visitor location headers`.
